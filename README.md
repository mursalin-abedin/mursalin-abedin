## &#x270d; ABOUT ME    
I am an aspiring full stack developer and currently a Java Student at Tech Elevator. I am a person who enjoys constant learning and facing challenges. I have ten yearsâ€™ experience in Accounting and Finance where I cultivated my strong analytical and problem-solving skills. As I was always interested in IT field and learning new coding languages, I decided to take my new career path as a software developer. After graduating, I am hoping to join a company where I will have the opportunity to grow my skill set and get more responsibilities as a senior developer with time.
