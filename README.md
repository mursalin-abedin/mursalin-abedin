I started in hands-on validation and support engineering, where accuracy mattered because results were shipped to real customers. That work trained me to think like a developer, test like a QA, and communicate like an analyst.

Now I’m focused on **Data Analytics + Data QA**: building reliable reporting, validating pipelines, and turning complex datasets into clear insights that business and engineering teams can act on.

## My Story: Telematics Support Engineer, Data Analytics, Data Validation Engineer 

In validation/support roles, I worked close with software releases and system behavior. What pulled me in most wasn’t just finding bugs, but proving **why** something happened using logs, data checks, and repeatable test evidence.

That same mindset is exactly what I bring to analytics today:
- Validate the data first (SQL checks, reconciliation, test queries)
- Understand how the pipeline works (inputs, transformations, outputs)
- Build reporting that is accurate and trusted (Power BI + clean definitions)
- Document everything so others can repeat it (test cases, SOPs, evidence)

---

## Core Strengths

- **Advanced SQL** (testing, validation queries, reconciliation)
- **Python analytics** (automation, data cleanup, repeatable checks)
- **ETL / pipeline thinking** (source-to-report troubleshooting)
- **Power BI + DAX** (dashboards, KPI tracking, stakeholder reporting)
- **Documentation and traceability** (requirements, test evidence, release notes)
- Tools: **AWS (S3), Git, Jira, Confluence, Swagger/Postman, JSON/XML**
